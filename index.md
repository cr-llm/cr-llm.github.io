## Overview

This seminar explores the intersection of causal machine learning and large language models. The central question examines whether LLMs' capabilities correspond to causal reasoning or are simply a result of dataset memorization and reliability concerns.

### Primary Focus Areas

#### 1. Integrating LLMs into Causal ML Workflows

The seminar addresses how LLMs can supply domain knowledge for causal tasks including effect inference, representation learning, causal discovery, and causal attribution.

#### 2. Evaluating and Improving LLM Causal Reasoning

Methods for assessing causal reasoning capabilities, developing training algorithms to enhance reliability, verifying causal statements, and leveraging causality to reduce hallucinations.

## Keywords
